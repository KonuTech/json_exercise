The Kimmeridgian escarpment of Fourchaume is reputed to produce some of the best Chablis wines -- and the South West exposure of the vines means that they bask in the warm afternoon sun. Vinified in stainless steel tanks (89%) to preserve the minerality and freshness, and in oak barrels (11%) of 228-litres to add more complex notes, this wine will continue to improve for the next 15 years or so."

Concentrated aromas of exotic fruits, grapefruit, passion fruit, mango and blood orange tempt the senses before unfolding to a structured, mineral-driven palate with a graphite finish that evokes the flint terroir of St. Gemme. Notes of orange zest linger on the beautifully balanced finish that leaves a saline impression."
